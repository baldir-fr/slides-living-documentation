== What is Documentation?

* Sharing knowledge

=== When?

* Knowledge needed for a long period of time -> Documented
* Knowledge needed by a large number of people -> Documented
* Knowledge valuable or critical -> Documented
* Default -> Don't


[.columns]
=== Generic Knowledge

[.column]
--
* Programming languages
* Developer tools
* Software practices
*** DDD
*** patterns
*** CI
--

[.column]
--
* Mature sector of the business industries
** Pricing in finance
** Supply Chain Optimization in e-commerce
** -> Industry standard books
--


[.columns]
=== Good news everyone!

[.column]
--
The Generic Knowledge is already documented in the industry literature.

-> Learn Generic Knowledge
-> Link to sources of Authority

[.column]

* Training
* Conferences
* Books
* Blog posts
* Standard Vocabulary
* ...

=== Focus on specific knowledge

* Knowledge your organization has and is not (yet) shared with other peers in the same industry.
* more expensive to learn
* takes practice, making mistakes to earn
* Deserves more attention
* Only you can take care about it


[.notes]
--
As a professional, you should know enough of the generic, industry standard knowledge, in order to be able to focus on growing the knowledge that's specific to you particular ambitions.

=== Stable/Unstable

[.column]
--
Stable

* Standards
* Most of parts of common industry
--
[.column]
--
Not Stable

* Marketing
* Company names
* Dates
* People
* Design decisions
--


=== Stable ‚Ä¢ Evergreen document

Useful content for a long period of time

* Short with not much details
* High Level focus
* Goals and intention (not implementaion details)
* More business oriented that technical

[%step]
Here traditional documentation is OK üëç


[.notes]
--
* Evergreen : Ce qui est stable = ce qui est toujours vrai
--

=== How to deal with Stable/Unstable?

Stable:: Learn & refer to it
Unstable:: Automate it as much as possible when it is useful

== Internal Documentation

Internal vs External

[.notes]
--
* External: Ms Word, Wiki, Jira...
** Advantages can be convenient for the audience and for the writers
** Inconvenient: hard or impossible to make it up to date
* Internal
** In Situ
** Machine-Readable
--

[.medium]
=== Problems with this knowledge

* Not accessible
* To many (noise)
* Scattered everywhere
* Implicit (e.g. design pattern visible only if we know it exists)
* Unrecoverable (lost)
* Unwritten

[%step]
Augment it, make it accessible for it's audience.

[.notes]
--
* Not accessible... (e.G to non technical people)
* To many (noise) only a few lines may be relevant for a question
* Scattered everywhere
* Implicit (e.g. design pattern visible only if we know it exists)
* Unrecoverable (lost) (people left)
* Unwritten: in someone's brain and only the consequences are in the system...
--

=== Single sourced

WIP TODO

[.notes]
--
* Single sourced = DRY de la doc
** On veut garantir qu'il y a une source unique pour une connaissance. Les repr√©sentations de cette connaissance devraient d√©couler de cette source.

[.columns]
=== Relability ‚Ä¢ Refactor Friendly

[.column]
--
* Put together things that change together (including documentation)
* Use code or language features to enable refactoring tooling
