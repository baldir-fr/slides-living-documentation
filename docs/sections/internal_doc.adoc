=== Focus on specific knowledge

* Knowledge your organization has and is not (yet) shared with other peers in the same industry.
* more expensive to learn
* takes practice, making mistakes to earn
* Deserves more attention
* Only you can take care about it

As a professional, you should know enough of the generic, industry standard knowledge, in order to be able to focus on growing the knowledge that's specific to you particular ambitions.

=== Problems with Internal Knowledge

* Not accessible
* To many (noise)
* Scattered everywhere
* Implicit (e.g. design pattern visible only if we know it exists)
* Unrecoverable (lost)
* Unwritten

[%step]
Augment it, make it accessible for it's audience.

[.notes]
--
* Not accessible... (e.G to non technical people)
* To many (noise) only a few lines may be relevant for a question
* Scattered everywhere
* Implicit (e.g. design pattern visible only if we know it exists)
* Unrecoverable (lost) (people left)
* Unwritten: in someone's brain and only the consequences are in the system...

=== Stable ‚Ä¢ Evergreen document

Useful content for a long period of time

* Short with not much details
* High Level focus
* Goals and intention (not implementaion details)
* More business oriented that technical

[%step]
Here traditional documentation is OK üëç
