Accurate and stays in sync with the system

* Fiable
* NÃ©cessite peu d'effort
* Collaborative
* RÃ©vÃ©latrice

=== Low-Effort

* Simplicity
* Standard over custom
* Evergreen content
* Refactoring proof Knowledge
* Internal Documentation

==== Easy to read and maintain

* Simplicity : best if nothing to declare, it's just obvious
* Standard over custom: Idiomatic, prefer link to external resource
* Evergreen content: Some knowledge never of rarely change
* Refactoring proof Knowledge: Refactoring tools propagate such changes
* Internal Documentation: Onto or close to the source material
--

=== Collaborative

* Favors conversations over formal documentation
* Collective Ownership

[.notes]
--

Invites to conversations and sharing knowledge with everyone involved

* Conversations : bande passante Ã©levÃ©e
* c'est ok si on ne note pas tout
* rÃ©pÃ©ter, rÃ©pÃ©ter, Ã  plusieurs personnes

* Ideas Sedimentation: over time decide what is worth the effort of recording in a persitent form
** Ideas sedimentation

=== Insightful

* Deliberate decision making
* Embedded learning
* Reality check

[.notes]
--

Helps understanding the work being done and reflect on it

* Deliberate decision making: You don't know clearly what you do? Maybe you may clarify your decisions, it may be more clear for you and others.
* Embedded learning: worker learn from the system itself
* Reality check: shows you the sad reality of your system
