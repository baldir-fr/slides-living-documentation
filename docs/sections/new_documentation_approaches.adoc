* Simplicity : best if nothing to declare, it's just obvious
* Standard over custom: Idiomatic, prefer link to external resource
* Evergreen content: Some knowledge never of rarely change

Helps understanding the work being done and reflect on it

* Embedded learning: worker learn from the system itself
* Reality check: shows you the sad reality of your system
