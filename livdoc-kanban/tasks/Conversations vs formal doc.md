> > - Communication usually fails, except by accident.
> >   - If communication can fail, it will
> >   - If communication cannot fail, it still most usually fails
> >   - If communication seems to succeed in the intended way, there's a misunderstanding
> >   - If you are content with your message, communication certainly fails
> > - If a message can be interpreted in several ways, it will be interpreted in a manner that maximizes the damage
> > - There is always someone who knows better than you what you meant with your message
> > - The more we communicate, the worse communication succeeds
> > 	- The more we communicate, the faster misunderstandings propagate
> > - In mass communication, the important thing is not how things are but how they seem to be
> > - The importance of a news item is inversely proportional to the square of the distance
> > - The more important the situation is, the more probably you forget an essential thing that you remembered a moment ago
