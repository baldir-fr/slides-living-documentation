## An onboarding story

First day of a new adventure.
After meeting my new colleagues, I am given a laptop on which a post-it with my credentials are written.

I open my session and check out my email. I read my welcome email which invite me to read the documentation.
A link to a Google drive.

When I open the drive folder I see:

```
PNX_2019-02_SPC_v3.doc

```
